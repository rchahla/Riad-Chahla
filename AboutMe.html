	<h1>About Me</h1></br>
	<hr class="w3-opacity2">
	<h2></br>I'm Riad Chahla, a sophomore software engineering student at Western University. I'm eager to learn coding in various languages because it enables me to work on personal projects that reflect my creativity. These projects help me improve my coding skills while allowing me to express myself.
During my spare time, I enjoy watching movies. They offer diverse perspectives, experiences, and ideas, often encouraging us to question our beliefs and gain a broader understanding of the world. Here are a few of my favorite films/shows:</h2>

		<li>The Dark Knight</li>

		<li>John Wick</li>
